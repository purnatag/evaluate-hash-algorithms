# eval_compression : Evaluation Pipeline for TLSH and other hashing schemes
---

This repository contains the file `eval.py`, used to evaluate the quality of compression exhibited by the hashing schemes `tlsh`, `ssdeep` and `sdhash` on system event signature logs.
Currently the only metric for evaluation is computation of locality.
